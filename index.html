        <p class="Title">Project 1: Memoria</p>
        <p class="Text">
          Project 1 was the biggest project I have ever been a part in, in this
          project I got to work on various areas, while making a fun project.
          One of the areas I worked in was technology and realization, as I
          worked on the code and mechanics to make the prototypes be
          interactable, I also worked on user and society IS THIS CORRECT? As we
          worked together with a therapist to get closer to our target group. I
          also worked on design research, and lastly professional skills, as I
          worked on both communication and report writing. Before going into the
          course, I had set a couple of goals, the first of which was to work on
          my communication skill, I did this by pushing my comfort zone and
          saying my opinion more as well as explain my thoughts and methods. My
          second goal was to work more with Blender, and I did get some chances
          to work on it, however I did not challenge myself enough and thus did
          not learn that many new things, so for next time I will push myself
          more. My third goal was to work more with prototyping, and I got a
          really good opportunity, the quick and dirty prototyping workshop,
          which showed me other ways of making prototypes, prototypes that are
          more low fidelity. Some things went less well in our team, for example
          I found it frustrating how people kept getting late, as I might as
          well come 15 minutes after the time we agreed on, since that was when
          people started coming, so for next time I will propose a system one of
          the other groups used, where people that are late get a strike and
          when you have x strikes you must do something. On the other side, a
          lot went well, first of all the atmosphere was great, it made
          communication a lot easier, and although I would love to take this
          along to next projects, I think it us fundamental, with the reason
          probably being the willingness to listen.
